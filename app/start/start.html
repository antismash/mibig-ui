      The Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) specification provides a robust community standard for
      annotations and metadata on biosynthetic gene clusters and their molecular products.
      <br> MIBiG is a Genomic Standards Consortium project that builds on the Minimum Information about any Sequence (MIxS) framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      MIBiG will facilitate the standardized deposition and retrieval of biosynthetic gene cluster data as well as the development
      of comprehensive comparative analysis tools. It will empower next-generation research on the biosynthesis, chemistry
      and ecology of broad classes of societally relevant bioactive secondary metabolites, guided by robust experimental
      evidence and rich metadata components.
    </p>

    <p>
      The JSON specifications of the MIBiG schema and options are freely available for download and can be used to validate MIBiG
      data from other sources. Also, a tarball with all MIBiG entries in raw JSON format is available for download. To get
      an idea of what kind of information is included in MIBiG entries, please have a look at the visualized entries for
      erythromycin, actinorhodin, calcium-dependent antibiotic, microbisporicin and marneral. They can be downloaded in JSON
      format by clicking the corresponding button (down-pointing arrow) at the top right of their page.
